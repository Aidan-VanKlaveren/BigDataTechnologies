## üìÇ Project Structure

### **1. Tweets Dataset and Neo4j Integration**
- **`10000tweets1`**: Dataset of 10,000 tweets used for graph database creation.
- **Neo4j Scripts:**
  - **`Assignment2Part2Imports.py`**: Imports the cleaned tweets dataset into Neo4j.
  - **`Assignment2Part3Queries.py`**: Contains Cypher queries to analyze and explore the graph database.
  - **`Assignment2bigdatatechnologies.py`**: Implements various graph algorithms, such as PageRank and community detection, using Neo4j.

### **2. DAG Creation and BigQuery Integration**
- **`bigquery_operator_dag.py`**: An Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) script to connect and interact with Google BigQuery for data processing and storage.

### **3. Documentation**
- **`Assignment3Queries.docx`**: Detailed documentation of the Cypher queries and their results, including insights gained from the graph database.
- **`youtube link.txt`**: Link to a demonstration video or walkthrough of the project.

### **4. Compressed Files**
- **`Assignment2AidanVanKlaveren.rar`**: Contains supplementary files or backup resources for Assignment 2.
